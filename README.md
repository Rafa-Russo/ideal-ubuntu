# Ideal Ubuntu
The purpose of this repository is to write down every change I make while configuring an Ubuntu machine, so I (and maybe even others!) can keep track of it.

## Wallpaper
Right now, I'm using the Carina Nebula photo taken by the James Webb telescope.

## Color Squeme
I used the Pywal command to get my color squeme to use it at the terminal.
